The larger 4.5 Yard HIPPOSKIP was developed to accommodate kitchen and larger bathroom installation projects.','Business Solutions','','inherit','open','open','','6-revision-v1','','','2015-05-20 07:12:53','2015-05-20 06:12:53','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/6-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(21,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','21','','','2015-05-20 11:21:46','2015-05-20 10:21:46','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=21',14,'nav_menu_item','',0),(22,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','22','','','2015-05-20 11:21:46','2015-05-20 10:21:46','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=22',9,'nav_menu_item','',0),(23,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','23','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=23',1,'nav_menu_item','',0),(24,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','24','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=24',7,'nav_menu_item','',0),(25,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','25','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=25',6,'nav_menu_item','',0),(26,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','26','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=26',5,'nav_menu_item','',0),(27,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','27','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=27',4,'nav_menu_item','',0),(28,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','28','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=28',3,'nav_menu_item','',0),(29,1,'2015-03-10 08:20:08','2015-03-10 08:20:08',' ','','','publish','open','open','','29','','','2015-05-20 11:21:45','2015-05-20 10:21:45','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=29',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(30,1,'2015-03-10 08:47:40','2015-03-10 08:47:40','<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plasterboard-Service-Image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-493\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plasterboard-Service-Image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"549\" /></a>Galliford Try used the HIPPOBAG system for disposing of the waste generated from a major refurbishment project of a building that was being converted into student accommodation. This meant creating a lot of small rooms using plasterboard.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of pallet trucks, Galliford Try were able to manoeuvre HIPPOBAGs within confined spaces to position them close to where work was being carried out. Once full, the timely collection guarded against double-handling of waste and the subsequent downtime usually associated with waiting for a skip to be delivered and collected.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 plasterboard was reclassified as a non-inert waste that needs to be disposed of separately at landfill at an increased cost. Different to traditional containers for waste, the HIPPOBAGs made it easier for the team on site to segregate the plasterboard from other waste materials so that it could be recycled, rather than sent to landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPO</h3>\r\n<em>\"The HIPPOBAG has not only provided Galliford Try with enhanced operational efficiences on site but also the ultimate solution for the segregation and subsequent recycling of plasterboard.\"</em>\r\n\r\nTerry O\'Neil, Site Manager, Galliford Try\r\n\r\n[/quote]','Plasterboard Recycling with Galliford Try','','publish','open','open','','plasterboard-recycling-case-study','','','2015-06-08 17:01:00','2015-06-08 16:01:00','',7,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?page_id=30',11,'page','',0),(31,1,'2015-03-10 08:47:40','2015-03-10 08:47:40','<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/contruction-casestudy.jpg\"><img class=\"  alignright wp-image-400\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/contruction-casestudy.jpg\" alt=\"Interior Fit-Out HIPPO\" width=\"400\" height=\"597\" /></a>Where working space is often at a premium, the HIPPOBAG provides an efficient and environmentally sound method of waste segregation and disposal. McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPO recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme. To support the on-site team, HIPPO delivered Toolbox Talks to promote best practice when it comes to positioning, filling and arranging collection of the bags.\r\n\r\nLocating HIPPOBAGs at the point of waste generation allowed McLaren to keep working areas tidy. By labelling the bags for each major waste stream, McLaren were able to fully segregate their material. This proactive approach meant HIPPO have reported that 97% of the waste collected was diverted from landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPO</h3>\r\n<em>\"Working in partnership with HIPPO on this project was the ideal solution. The MIDIBAGS allowed us to keep the site tidy, whilst segregating the waste before collection boosted our recycling rates resulting in 97% diversion from landfill.\"</em>\r\n\r\nLeigh Steele, Fit-out Manager, McLaren Construction\r\n\r\n[/quote]','Interior Fit-Out with John Lewis and McLaren Construction','','publish','open','open','','retail-case-study','','','2015-06-08 16:59:53','2015-06-08 15:59:53','',7,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?page_id=31',12,'page','',0),(32,1,'2015-03-10 08:47:40','2015-03-10 08:47:40','<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy-e1426505179570.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-398\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy-e1426505179570.jpg\" alt=\"construction HIPPO\" width=\"400\" height=\"596\" /></a>HIPPO was awarded the waste management contract by Wates Retail for the construction of Europe’s largest John Lewis department store in Liverpool. The new 240,000 square foot, multi-million pound John Lewis store is part of The Paradise Project – a regeneration project covering 42 acres in the heart of the city.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt over five storeys high, this complex construction development required a flexible, easily transportable waste removal solution. Using HIPPOBAGs enabled Wates to set up waste segregation on each of the four sales floors, making it easy for the site teams to separate the waste at source.\r\n\r\nThe bags could then be easily manoeuvred to the ground floor, where they were placed for collection with no need to double handle the waste into another container.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPO</h3>\r\n<em>\"The different sized HIPPOBAGs are ideal for the various waste streams generated on site and to date the flexibility and versatility afforded by this solution has enabled us to achieve 97% recycling in our first month on site.

By working together with any existing waste contracts you have, we can assist you in reconstructing your waste services.\r\n\r\nOur service is not a regular scheduled waste collection covered by a bin contract, so you can use us for unexpected waste events whenever you need us.

This in return helps you to achieve your diversion from landfill objectives.\r\n\r\nWith HIPPOWASTE you’ll also benefit from the flexibility of an instant and non-bulky waste solution that is transportable and bespoke to your project. HIPPOWASTE work around your business, with our flat packed bags able to be used at any time – up to a year –after purchase, and being collected at a time of your convenience.

Through our dedicated plasterboard disposal and recycling scheme, we recycle 100% of uncontaminated plasterboard that we collect. HIPPO’s environmental values mean that you can ensure that you are disposing of your waste in a responsible and eco-friendly manner.\r\n<h2>Installations</h2>\r\nHIPPOWASTE offers an ideal service for installations. We understand the importance of minimising disruption and inconvenience to customers and their surrounding properties during a domestic remodelling. HIPPOBAGs ensure that waste is kept neatly and takes up as little room as possible.\r\n\r\nHIPPOBAGs come flat packed, so don’t waste room before they are used.

We understand that a variety of waste can be produced in construction tasks, and ensure that even hazardous waste and plasterboard are dealt with responsibly and efficiently in our waste logistics projects.\r\n\r\nWith HIPPO, you only have to deal with one supplier for all of your waste disposal needs, meaning that we can develop a bespoke solution for your specific needs – giving you maximum efficiency and flexibility even in the largest of construction waste logistics tasks.\r\n<h2>Facilities Management</h2>\r\nUsing the HIPPOBAG to deal with heavy or bulk inert waste streams and ad hoc waste events will provide you with a number of benefits in managing waste disposal across your national or regional store estate. By working together with any existing waste contracts you have, we can assist you in reconstructing your waste services.\r\n\r\nOur service is not a regular scheduled waste collection covered by a bin contract, so you can use us for unexpected waste events whenever you need us. With thousands of HIPPOBAGS collected from store estates weekly, HIPPO provides a flexible, convenient and ethical service for your business.\r\n<h2>Housing and Renovation</h2>\r\nWe have collected over half a million HIPPOBAGs from residential properties, so we understand the challenges of waste disposal in the process of improving social housing and transforming neighbourhoods.\r\n<h2>Retail and Office Fitout</h2>\r\nDuring the refurbishment or fit out stage of retail and office premises, using a HIPPOBAG allows you to segregate waste streams on site, helping you to achieve increased recycling rates. This in return helps you to achieve your diversion from landfill objectives.\r\n\r\nWith HIPPOWASTE you’ll also benefit from the flexibility of an instant and non-bulky waste solution that is transportable and bespoke to your project. HIPPOWASTE work around your business, with our flat packed bags able to be used at any time – up to a year –after purchase, and being collected at a time of your convenience. This way you no-longer have to wait for skip deliveries or collections that clutter sites, hampering the progress of your workforce.\r\n<h2>Plasterboard Recycling</h2>\r\nHIPPOWASTE also offer a quick and cost effective way of getting rid of plasterboard from your site or property. Through our dedicated plasterboard disposal and recycling scheme, we recycle 100% of uncontaminated plasterboard that we collect. HIPPO’s environmental values mean that you can ensure that you are disposing of your waste in a responsible and eco-friendly manner.\r\n<h2>Installations</h2>\r\nHIPPOWASTE offers an ideal service for installations.

HIPPOBAGs ensure that waste is kept neatly and takes up as little room as possible.\r\n\r\nHIPPOBAGs come flat packed, so don’t waste room before they are used. In addition, our reliable and flexible courier service means that you can arrange for your HIPPOBAG to be picked up at a convenient time for you. HIPPOBAGS can also be left on your – or your customer’s – property, making them far more tidy and convenient than a traditional skip that would be left on the road.\r\n\r\nFor bathroom installations, the 1.5 cubic yard MEGABAG is ideal, able to hold an entire bathroom suite.

With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from the customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical decent homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has capacity for both a bathroom suite AND a medium kitchen.','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-03-11 11:37:10','2015-03-11 11:37:10','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=130',0,'revision','',0),(250,2,'2015-03-12 10:46:12','2015-03-12 10:46:12','The MIGHTYBAG (aka the HIPPOSKIP<sup>TM</sup>) was designed with kitchen and large bathroom installations in mind.

McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPOWASTE recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HOUSINGMAINTENANCE.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-142\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HOUSINGMAINTENANCE-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"HOUSINGMAINTENANCE\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme.

When you are finished with your HIPPOBAG, simply arrange a collection and our professional couriers will collect your waste and dispose of it responsibly.\r\n\r\nHIPPOBAGs also take up very little space and you can suit the size of bag to the size of your project, this means you don’t need to pay the full price that you would for a skip if your needs are smaller.\r\n\r\nHIPPO’s environmental policies mean that you can be reassured that your waste is being handled and disposed of in a responsible manner. We typically recycle around 90% of the waste that we collect. HIPPO are also committed to excellent customer service and have an excellent average customer review rating of 4.7 out of 5.\r\n<h2>Our Waste Logistics Experts</h2>\r\nHIPPOWASTE provide waste logistics services for a great number of projects. Whether you require waste management in projects such as as new build and construction, housing and renovation, facilities management, kitchen and bathroom installation, retail and office fit out or virtually any project where waste is produced. HIPPOWASTE also run a dedicated plasterboard disposal and recycling scheme, where we collect uncontaminated plasterboard and recycle 100% of it.\r\n\r\nWith HIPPO’s trusted, project–specific approach we can suit our service perfectly to your waste logistics needs, whilst ensuring that you receive value for money and that your waste is dealt with responsibly.','About HIPPOWASTE','','inherit','open','open','','33-revision-v1','','','2015-03-11 13:36:36','2015-03-11 13:36:36','',33,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?p=174',0,'revision','',0),(175,2,'2015-03-11 13:36:50','2015-03-11 13:36:50','HIPPO™ is a national provider of innovative and integrated waste logistics solutions, the HIPPOWASTE service caters to the needs of building and construction professionals for their waste removal.\r\n\r\nDriven by the desire to provide an affordable, convenient and reliable waste logistics service for your business, HIPPOWASTE use our innovative yellow HIPPOBAG.

What’s more, our national transport infrastructure means wherever you are, you will receive a reliable collection service that you can trust.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility of HIPPOBAGs allow for easy waste collection from tight, restricted sites. In addition, our national service means we can offer you a solution wherever you are in the country.\r\n\r\nConstruction sites around the country use HIPPO because of the lightweight and flexible nature of our convenient HIPPOBAGs, as well as our excellent customer service and convenience. Collections can be made from different areas on large sites, including from scaffolding or loading bays, to improve site efficiency.\r\n\r\nHippo can also ensure that you only have one supplier for all your site waste needs, including hazardous waste and <a href=\"http://www.hippowaste.co.uk/case-studies/plasterboard-recycling\">plasterboard</a>. We recycle around 90 per cent of the waste that we collect, so you can rest assured that your operation will be carried out ethically and responsibly.\r\n\r\nDifferent bag sizes make it easy to segregate waste streams and improve diversion from landfill, whilst a variety of size options mean that you only ever pay for what you need, as well as saving space on site.

Our training is themed around individuals’ career objectives, departmental requirements, and wider business needs or changes, making sure we’re all ready for our next challenge.\r\n\r\nWe are particularly proud of our team’s career progression – we’re not a huge organisation, but through creative thinking, an eye for talent, and the flexibility that comes with the Company’s growth and development, we have been able to spot opportunities for people to move to roles which are more senior, more challenging, or represent a change of career. This is great for us, as we retain our committed and talented people; and it allows people with talent and ambition to pursue their career aspirations. 9% of our team were promoted into their current roles, and 12% have moved to a different role during their time with HIPPO.\r\n\r\nTo apply for any of vacancies, please email your CV with a covering letter to recruitment@hippowaste.co.uk or post it to: HR Department, HIPPO, 1000 Lakeside, North Harbour, Portsmouth PO6 3EN\r\n<h2>Current Vacancies</h2>\r\nWe have no current vacancies.','Careers at HIPPOWASTE','','inherit','open','open','','34-revision-v1','','','2015-03-11 19:52:46','2015-03-11 19:52:46','',34,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/34-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(222,1,'2015-03-11 19:53:31','2015-03-11 19:53:31','Ensuring that existing housing supply across the country is well-maintained and meets a minimum standard of decency is fundamental to healthy and happy communities. HIPPO™ is ideally placed to support refurbishment projects in this vital field.\r\n\r\nWe have a thorough grasp of your challenges in disposing of the waste generated in the process of improving social housing and transforming neighbourhoods – compounded by operating to strict deadlines and within tight budgets. HIPPO provide a nationwide network for rapid collection, meaning that you can use our services for your waste logistics needs wherever you are in the country.\r\n\r\nHIPPO offer a choice of 3 bag sizes, meaning that we have the perfect bag for you to complete your job. These bags come flat packed, so there is no need to wait for a skip or have to worry about regional skip prices.\r\n\r\nHIPPO has collected over 500,000 bags from domestic properties since 2005. With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has the capacity to hold both a bathroom suite and a medium kitchen.','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-03-11 19:53:31','2015-03-11 19:53:31','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(227,1,'2015-03-11 19:55:32','2015-03-11 19:55:32','<strong>Website Terms and Conditions:</strong>\r\n\r\nUse of this website constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions, which take effect immediately on your first use of the website.

With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property.

A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has the capacity to hold both a bathroom suite and a medium kitchen.','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-03-12 10:39:22','2015-03-12 10:39:22','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(255,2,'2015-03-12 11:24:02','2015-03-12 11:24:02','<h1>Case Studies</h1>\r\nRead our case studies about the effectiveness of HIPPOWASTE, and learn how we could help your business:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction-icon1.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-94\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction-icon1-150x150.png\" alt=\"construction-icon\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></a>Construction</h2>\r\nWates Retails used the HIPPOWASTE service for the construction of Liverpool\'s John Lewis store, with huge success.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-offices-fitout-icon.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-99\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-offices-fitout-icon-150x150.png\" alt=\"retail-offices-fitout-icon\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></a>Office &amp; Retail Fit-Out</h2>\r\nThe HIPPOWASTE service assisted in the Fit-Out of John Lewis alongside McLaren Construction.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plasterboard-icon.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-98\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/plasterboard-icon-150x150.png\" alt=\"plasterboard-icon\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></a>Plasterboard</h2>\r\nGalliford Try had some tricky plasterboard removal which they needed HIPPO\'s help with.','Case Studies','','inherit','open','open','','7-revision-v1','','','2015-03-12 11:24:02','2015-03-12 11:24:02','',7,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/7-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(257,2,'2015-03-12 11:31:19','2015-03-12 11:31:19','<img class=\"  wp-image-142 alignright\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HOUSINGMAINTENANCE-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"HOUSINGMAINTENANCE\" width=\"262\" height=\"331\" />Where working space is often at a premium, the HIPPOBAG provides an efficient and environmentally sound method of waste segregation and disposal. McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPOWASTE recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme. To support the on-site team, HIPPOWASTE delivered Toolbox Talks to promote best practice when it comes to positioning, filling and arranging collection of the bags.\r\n\r\nLocating HIPPOBAGs at the point of waste generation allowed McLaren to keep working areas tidy. By labelling the bags for each major waste stream, McLaren were able to fully segregate their material. This proactive approach meant HIPPOWASTE have reported that 97% of the waste collected was diverted from landfill and recycled.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h2>What They Said About HIPPOWASTE</h2>\r\n<em>\"Working in partnership with HIPPOWASTE on this project was the ideal solution.

You can also segregate waste into different streams using HIPPOBAGs, allowing you to increase recycling rates.\r\n\r\nHIPPO’s environmental policies mean you can rest assured that your waste is being handled and disposed of in a responsible manner.

HIPPO is ideally placed to support refurbishment projects in this vital field.\r\n\r\nWe have a thorough grasp of the challenges in disposing of waste generated in the process of improving social housing and transforming neighbourhoods – compounded by operating to strict deadlines and within tight budgets.\r\n\r\nHIPPO has collected over 500,000 bags from domestic properties since 2005. With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n\r\nHIPPO provide a nationwide network for rapid collection, meaning that you can use our services for your waste logistics needs wherever you are in the country.\r\n\r\nWe offer a choice of 3 bag sizes, meaning that whatever size project you\'re undertaking, we have the perfect bag for you to complete your job. These bags come flat packed, so there is no need to wait for a skip or have to worry about regional skip prices and availability.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams.

The 4.5 cubic yard bag is ideal for light, bulky waste, and can easily accommodate the waste created by a standard kitchen installation. In fact, our customers find that 78% of all kitchen installations fit into a single MIGHTYBAG. For bathroom installations, the 1.5 cubic yard MEGABAG will contain a complete bathroom suite, making it the perfect solution for getting rid of waste in one simple operation.\r\n\r\nAll HIPPOBAGs come flat packed, so can easily be stored until needed. In addition, the flexible sides of our bags mean that no void space is created, saving valuable room around your project. The use of a MIGHTYBAG means you pay for an average of 4.77 yds of waste per job, compared with 5.5 – 6 yards in a rigid skip. By using HIPPOWASTE you will be able to save money as well time, benefiting from the most convenient waste solution on the market.\r\n\r\nWith HIPPO\'s flexible courier service, there is no need to wait for the arrival or collection of skips, meaning that you can just get on with the job and arrange a collection at a convenient time for you.\r\n\r\nOur customers often save as much as <strong>£70 on each rip-out</strong>.

This meant creating a lot of small rooms using plasterboard.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of pallet trucks, Galliford Try were able to manoeuvre HIPPOBAGs within confined spaces to position them close to where work was being carried out. Once full, the timely collection guarded against double-handling of waste and the subsequent downtime usually associated with waiting for a skip to be delivered and collected.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, plasterboard was recently reclassified as a non-inert waste that now needs to be disposed of separately at landfill at an increased cost. Different to traditional containers for waste, the HIPPOBAGs made it easier for the team on site to segregate the plasterboard from other waste materials so that it could be recycled, rather than sent to landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"The HIPPOBAG has not only provided Galliford Try with enhanced operational efficiences on site but also the ultimate solution for the segregation and subsequent recycling of plasterboard.\"</em>\r\n\r\nTerry O\'Neil, Site Manager, Galliford Try<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/INSTALLATIONS2.jpg\">\r\n</a>\r\n[/quote]','Plasterboard Recycling with Galliford Try','','inherit','open','open','','30-revision-v1','','','2015-03-13 12:23:27','2015-03-13 12:23:27','',30,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/30-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(278,2,'2015-03-13 11:51:45','2015-03-13 11:51:45','Choosing a waste logistics company is a vital decision.

HIPPOWASTE provide a reliable, affordable and convenient national skip alternative for any sized business. Our innovative HIPPOBAG comes in three convenient sizes and is available either online or from our trusted stockists around the UK.\r\n\r\nA HIPPOBAG is the perfect alternative to traditional skip hire for a number of reasons; a HIPPOBAG is bought flat packed and can be used at a convenient time for you, where you would have a limited time if you hired a skip. When you are finished with your HIPPOBAG, simply arrange a collection and our professional couriers will collect your waste and dispose of it responsibly.\r\n\r\nHIPPOBAGs also take up very little space, and you can suit the size of bag to the specific needs of your project; this means you don’t need to pay the full price that you would for a skip if your needs are smaller. You can also segregate waste into different streams using HIPPOBAGs, allowing you to increase recycling rates.\r\n\r\nHIPPO’s environmental policies mean you can rest assured that your waste is being handled and disposed of in a responsible manner. We typically recycle around 90% of the waste that we collect. HIPPO are also committed to excellent customer service and have an average customer review rating of 4.7 out of 5.\r\n<h2>Our Waste Logistics Experts</h2>\r\nHIPPOWASTE provide waste logistics services for a huge variety of projects. Whether you require waste logistics in new build and construction, housing and renovation, facilities management, kitchen and bathroom installation, retail and office fit out or virtually any waste-producing project; HIPPO offer the ideal service for your needs.\r\n\r\nHIPPOWASTE also run a dedicated plasterboard disposal and recycling scheme, where we collect uncontaminated plasterboard and recycle 100% of it.\r\n\r\nWith HIPPO’s trusted, flexible and project–specific approach, we can suit our services perfectly to your waste logistics needs, whilst ensuring that you receive value for money and  that your waste is dealt with responsibly.','About HIPPOWASTE','','inherit','open','open','','33-revision-v1','','','2015-03-13 17:18:46','2015-03-13 17:18:46','',33,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/33-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(318,2,'2015-03-13 17:20:48','2015-03-13 17:20:48','','PBWPIX','','inherit','open','open','','pbwpix','','','2015-03-13 17:21:02','2015-03-13 17:21:02','',34,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/careers.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(405,2,'2015-06-01 11:31:41','2015-06-01 10:31:41','<img class=\"alignright wp-image-321\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/careers1.jpg\" alt=\"careers\" width=\"455\" height=\"410\" />The chances are when you join us, you\'ll have more than a job in mind.

McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPOWASTE recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme. To support the on-site team, HIPPOWASTE delivered Toolbox Talks to promote best practice when it comes to positioning, filling and arranging collection of the bags.\r\n\r\nLocating HIPPOBAGs at the point of waste generation allowed McLaren to keep working areas tidy. By labelling the bags for each major waste stream, McLaren were able to fully segregate their material. This proactive approach meant HIPPOWASTE have reported that 97% of the waste collected was diverted from landfill and recycled.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"Working in partnership with HIPPOWASTE on this project was the ideal solution. The MIDIBAGS allowed us to keep the site tidy, whilst segregating the waste before collection boosted our recycling rates resulting in 97% diversion from landfill.\"</em>\r\n\r\nLeigh Steele, Fit-out Manager, McLaren Construction','Interior Fit-Out with John Lewis and McLaren Construction','','inherit','open','open','','31-revision-v1','','','2015-03-14 09:33:14','2015-03-14 09:33:14','',31,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/31-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(351,2,'2015-03-14 09:33:50','2015-03-14 09:33:50','HIPPOWASTE was awarded the waste management contract by Wates Retail for the construction of Europe’s largest John Lewis department store in Liverpool. The new 240,000 square foot, multi-million pound John Lewis store is part of The Paradise Project – a regeneration project covering 42 acres in the heart of the city.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" size-medium wp-image-144 alignright\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/OFFICEFITOUT1-199x300.jpg\" alt=\"OFFICEFITOUT\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\nAt over five storeys high, this complex construction development required a flexible, easily transportable waste removal solution. Using HIPPOBAGs enabled Wates to set up waste segregation on each of the four sales floors, making it easy for the site teams to separate the waste at source.\r\n\r\nThe bags could then be easily manoeuvred to the ground floor, where they were placed for collection with no need to double handle the waste into another container.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"The different sized HIPPOBAGs are ideal for the various waste streams generated on site and to date the flexibility and versatility afforded by this solution has enabled us to achieve 97% recycling in our first month on site.

The larger 4.5 Yard HIPPOSKIP was developed to accommodate kitchen and larger bathroom installation projects.','Services','','inherit','open','open','','6-revision-v1','','','2015-03-16 09:02:42','2015-03-16 09:02:42','',6,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/6-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(368,1,'2015-03-16 09:14:23','2015-03-16 09:14:23','','Blog','','publish','open','open','','blog','','','2015-03-16 09:31:58','2015-03-16 09:31:58','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/?page_id=368',0,'page','',0),(369,1,'2015-03-16 09:14:23','2015-03-16 09:14:23','','Blog','','inherit','open','open','','368-revision-v1','','','2015-03-16 09:14:23','2015-03-16 09:14:23','',368,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/368-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(488,0,'2015-04-18 15:59:18','2015-04-18 14:59:18','','Daily backup - April 18, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-april-18-2015-2','','','2015-04-18 15:59:18','2015-04-18 14:59:18','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-april-18-2015-2/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(489,0,'2015-04-20 01:11:32','2015-04-20 00:11:32','','Daily backup - April 20, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-april-20-2015','','','2015-04-20 01:11:32','2015-04-20 00:11:32','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-april-20-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(490,0,'2015-04-23 09:09:26','2015-04-23 08:09:26','','Daily backup - April 23, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-april-23-2015','','','2015-04-23 09:09:26','2015-04-23 08:09:26','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-april-23-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(491,0,'2015-04-27 12:21:01','2015-04-27 11:21:01','','Daily backup - April 27, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-april-27-2015','','','2015-04-27 12:21:01','2015-04-27 11:21:01','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-april-27-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(492,0,'2015-04-30 11:32:48','2015-04-30 10:32:48','','Daily backup - April 30, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-april-30-2015','','','2015-04-30 11:32:48','2015-04-30 10:32:48','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-april-30-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(495,2,'2015-06-05 15:02:22','2015-06-05 14:02:22','<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plasterboard-Service-Image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-493\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plasterboard-Service-Image.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"549\" /></a>Galliford Try used the HIPPOBAG system for disposing of the waste generated from a major refurbishment project of a building that was being converted into student accommodation.

HIPPO is ideally placed to support refurbishment projects in this vital field.\r\n\r\nWe have a thorough grasp of the challenges in disposing of waste generated in the process of improving social housing and transforming neighbourhoods – compounded by operating to strict deadlines and within tight budgets.\r\n<h2>hassle free collection</h2>\r\nHIPPO has collected over 500,000 bags from domestic properties since 2005. With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n<h2>Nationwide</h2>\r\nHIPPO provide a nationwide network for rapid collection, meaning that you can use our services for your waste logistics needs wherever you are in the country.\r\n<h2>3 bag sizes</h2>\r\nWe offer a choice of 3 bag sizes, meaning that whatever size project you\'re undertaking, we have the perfect bag for you to complete your job. These bags come flat packed, so there is no need to wait for a skip or have to worry about regional skip prices and availability.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has the capacity to hold both a bathroom suite and a medium kitchen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-383\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\" alt=\"construction HIPPO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"578\" /></a>','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-03-16 10:46:57','2015-03-16 10:46:57','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(385,2,'2015-03-16 10:51:22','2015-03-16 10:51:22','','installations','','inherit','open','open','','installations-2','','','2015-03-16 10:51:33','2015-03-16 10:51:33','',12,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/installations1.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(386,2,'2015-03-16 10:51:50','2015-03-16 10:51:50','<h2>HIPPO Provide Waste Logistics Services to Kitchen and Bathroom Installers</h2>\r\nThe MIGHTYBAG (aka the HIPPOSKIP) was designed with kitchen and large bathroom installations in mind. The 4.5 cubic yard bag is ideal for light, bulky waste, and can easily accommodate the waste created by a standard kitchen installation. In fact, our customers find that 78% of all kitchen installations fit into a single MIGHTYBAG. For bathroom installations, the 1.5 cubic yard MEGABAG will contain a complete bathroom suite, making it the perfect solution for getting rid of waste in one simple operation.\r\n<h2>flat packed</h2>\r\nAll HIPPOBAGs come flat packed, so can easily be stored until needed. In addition, the flexible sides of our bags mean that no void space is created, saving valuable room around your project.

This meant creating a lot of small rooms using plasterboard.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of pallet trucks, Galliford Try were able to manoeuvre HIPPOBAGs within confined spaces to position them close to where work was being carried out. Once full, the timely collection guarded against double-handling of waste and the subsequent downtime usually associated with waiting for a skip to be delivered and collected.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, plasterboard was recently reclassified as a non-inert waste that now needs to be disposed of separately at landfill at an increased cost. Different to traditional containers for waste, the HIPPOBAGs made it easier for the team on site to segregate the plasterboard from other waste materials so that it could be recycled, rather than sent to landfill.\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"The HIPPOBAG has not only provided Galliford Try with enhanced operational efficiences on site but also the ultimate solution for the segregation and subsequent recycling of plasterboard.\"</em>\r\n\r\nTerry O\'Neil, Site Manager, Galliford Try','Plasterboard Recycling with Galliford Try','','inherit','open','open','','30-revision-v1','','','2015-03-16 11:17:10','2015-03-16 11:17:10','',30,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/30-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(398,2,'2015-03-16 11:25:15','2015-03-16 11:25:15','','constuction-casestudy','','inherit','open','open','','retail-casestudy','','','2015-04-08 09:53:27','2015-04-08 08:53:27','',31,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(409,1,'2015-03-23 06:31:37','2015-03-23 06:31:37','<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy-e1426505179570.jpg\"><img class=\"  alignright wp-image-398\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy-e1426505179570.jpg\" alt=\"Retail casestudy HIPPO\" width=\"369\" height=\"550\" /></a>Where working space is often at a premium, the HIPPOBAG provides an efficient and environmentally sound method of waste segregation and disposal.

In fact, our customers find that 78% of all kitchen installations fit into a single MIGHTYBAG. For bathroom installations, the 1.5 cubic yard MEGABAG will contain a complete bathroom suite, making it the perfect solution for getting rid of waste in one simple operation.\r\n<h2>flat packed</h2>\r\nAll HIPPOBAGs come flat packed, so can easily be stored until needed.

This meant creating a lot of small rooms using plasterboard.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of pallet trucks, Galliford Try were able to manoeuvre HIPPOBAGs within confined spaces to position them close to where work was being carried out. Once full, the timely collection guarded against double-handling of waste and the subsequent downtime usually associated with waiting for a skip to be delivered and collected.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, plasterboard was recently reclassified as a non-inert waste that now needs to be disposed of separately at landfill at an increased cost. Different to traditional containers for waste, the HIPPOBAGs made it easier for the team on site to segregate the plasterboard from other waste materials so that it could be recycled, rather than sent to landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"The HIPPOBAG has not only provided Galliford Try with enhanced operational efficiences on site but also the ultimate solution for the segregation and subsequent recycling of plasterboard.\"</em>\r\n\r\nTerry O\'Neil, Site Manager, Galliford Try\r\n\r\n[/quote]','Plasterboard Recycling with Galliford Try','','inherit','open','open','','30-revision-v1','','','2015-04-08 09:55:01','2015-04-08 08:55:01','',30,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/30-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(493,2,'2015-04-30 11:55:19','2015-04-30 10:55:19','','Plasterboard-Service-Image','','inherit','open','open','','plasterboard-service-image','','','2015-04-30 11:55:19','2015-04-30 10:55:19','',30,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Plasterboard-Service-Image.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(483,0,'2015-04-09 17:15:06','2015-04-09 16:15:06','','Daily backup - April 9, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-april-9-2015','','','2015-04-09 17:15:06','2015-04-09 16:15:06','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-april-9-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(498,0,'2015-05-06 12:26:42','2015-05-06 11:26:42','','Daily backup - May 6, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-6-2015','','','2015-05-06 12:26:42','2015-05-06 11:26:42','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-6-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(499,0,'2015-05-08 12:24:07','2015-05-08 11:24:07','','Daily backup - May 8, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-8-2015','','','2015-05-08 12:24:07','2015-05-08 11:24:07','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-8-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(500,0,'2015-05-11 16:55:46','2015-05-11 15:55:46','','Daily backup - May 11, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-11-2015','','','2015-05-11 16:55:46','2015-05-11 15:55:46','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-11-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(501,0,'2015-05-12 10:50:49','2015-05-12 09:50:49','','Daily backup - May 12, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-12-2015','','','2015-05-12 10:50:49','2015-05-12 09:50:49','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-12-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(502,0,'2015-05-14 16:55:16','2015-05-14 15:55:16','','Daily backup - May 14, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-14-2015','','','2015-05-14 16:55:16','2015-05-14 15:55:16','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-14-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(503,0,'2015-05-15 09:16:22','2015-05-15 08:16:22','','Daily backup - May 15, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-15-2015','','','2015-05-15 09:16:22','2015-05-15 08:16:22','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-15-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(504,0,'2015-05-18 21:07:23','2015-05-18 20:07:23','','Daily backup - May 18, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-18-2015','','','2015-05-18 21:07:23','2015-05-18 20:07:23','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-18-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(505,0,'2015-05-20 07:07:42','2015-05-20 06:07:42','','Daily backup - May 20, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-20-2015','','','2015-05-20 07:07:42','2015-05-20 06:07:42','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-20-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(521,0,'2015-06-01 10:58:12','2015-06-01 09:58:12','','Daily backup - June 1, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-june-1-2015','','','2015-06-01 10:58:12','2015-06-01 09:58:12','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-june-1-2015/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(508,0,'2015-05-20 08:49:09','2015-05-20 07:49:09','','Daily backup - May 20, 2015','','publish','open','open','','daily-backup-may-20-2015-2','','','2015-05-20 08:49:09','2015-05-20 07:49:09','',0,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/daily-backup-may-20-2015-2/',0,'revisr_commits','',0),(510,2,'2015-05-20 11:13:04','2015-05-20 10:13:04','<h2>HIPPO Provide Waste Logistics Services to Projects Across the Construction Sector</h2>\r\nFrom helping you plan the volume and types of waste you’ll encounter, to knowing where your waste is going and what level of recycling you can achieve, HIPPO works with you from start to finish to help to deliver your project efficiently.

The 4.5 cubic yard bag is ideal for light, bulky waste, and can easily accommodate the waste created by a standard kitchen installation. In fact, our customers find that 90% of all kitchen installations fit into a single MIGHTYBAG. For bathroom installations, the 1.5 cubic yard MEGABAG will contain a complete bathroom suite, making it the perfect solution for getting rid of waste in one simple operation.\r\n<h2>flat packed</h2>\r\nAll HIPPOBAGs come flat packed, so can easily be stored until needed.

The use of a MIGHTYBAG means you pay for an average of 4.77 yds of waste per job, compared with 5.5 – 6 yards in a rigid skip. By using HIPPOWASTE you will be able to save money as well time, benefiting from the most convenient waste solution on the market.\r\n<h2>flexible</h2>\r\nWith HIPPO\'s flexible courier service, there is no need to wait for the arrival or collection of skips, meaning that you can just get on with the job and arrange a collection at a convenient time for you.\r\n<h2>savings</h2>\r\nOur customers often save as much as <strong>£70 on each rip-out</strong>.

This way you can take greater control of your waste logistics operation and avoid unnecessary hassle during your retail or office fit out project.\r\n<h2>3 different sizes</h2>\r\nHIPPO’s strong, non-bulky skip alternatives come in three different sizes, so you can match the size of the HIPPOBAG you purchase to the size of the project you are undertaking, meaning that you will never pay for more than you need and will save valuable space around your project.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/case-studies/retail-case-study/\">Read our retail and office fit-out case study here</a>.','Retail and Office Fit-out','','inherit','open','open','','13-revision-v1','','','2015-06-01 11:15:50','2015-06-01 10:15:50','',13,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/13-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(531,2,'2015-06-01 11:20:39','2015-06-01 10:20:39','Ensuring that existing housing supply across the country is well-maintained and meets a minimum standard of decency is fundamental to healthy and happy communities. HIPPO is ideally placed to support refurbishment projects in this vital field.\r\n\r\nWe have a thorough grasp of the challenges in disposing of waste generated in the process of creating and improving affordable housing and transforming neighbourhoods – compounded by operating to strict deadlines and within tight budgets.\r\n<h2>hassle free collection</h2>\r\nHIPPO has collected over 500,000 bags from domestic properties since 2005. With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n<h2>Nationwide</h2>\r\nHIPPO provides a nationwide network for rapid collection, meaning that you can use our services for your waste logistics needs wherever you are in the country.\r\n<h2>3 bag sizes</h2>\r\nWe offer a choice of 3 bag sizes, meaning that whatever size project you\'re undertaking, we have the perfect bag for you to complete your job. These bags come flat packed, so there is no need to wait for a skip or have to worry about regional skip prices and availability.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has the capacity to hold both a bathroom suite and a medium kitchen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-383\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\" alt=\"construction HIPPO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"578\" /></a>','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-06-01 11:20:39','2015-06-01 10:20:39','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(532,2,'2015-06-01 11:23:32','2015-06-01 10:23:32','<strong>Website Terms and Conditions:</strong>\r\n\r\nUse of this website constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions, which take effect immediately on your first use of the website.

McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPOWASTE recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme. To support the on-site team, HIPPOWASTE delivered Toolbox Talks to promote best practice when it comes to positioning, filling and arranging collection of the bags.\r\n\r\nLocating HIPPOBAGs at the point of waste generation allowed McLaren to keep working areas tidy. By labelling the bags for each major waste stream, McLaren were able to fully segregate their material. This proactive approach meant HIPPOWASTE have reported that 97% of the waste collected was diverted from landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"Working in partnership with HIPPOWASTE on this project was the ideal solution.

This meant creating a lot of small rooms using plasterboard.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of pallet trucks, Galliford Try were able to manoeuvre HIPPOBAGs within confined spaces to position them close to where work was being carried out. Once full, the timely collection guarded against double-handling of waste and the subsequent downtime usually associated with waiting for a skip to be delivered and collected.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 plasterboard was reclassified as a non-inert waste that needs to be disposed of separately at landfill at an increased cost. Different to traditional containers for waste, the HIPPOBAGs made it easier for the team on site to segregate the plasterboard from other waste materials so that it could be recycled, rather than sent to landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"The HIPPOBAG has not only provided Galliford Try with enhanced operational efficiences on site but also the ultimate solution for the segregation and subsequent recycling of plasterboard.\"</em>\r\n\r\nTerry O\'Neil, Site Manager, Galliford Try\r\n\r\n[/quote]','Plasterboard Recycling with Galliford Try','','inherit','open','open','','30-revision-v1','','','2015-06-05 15:03:27','2015-06-05 14:03:27','',30,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/30-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(548,2,'2015-06-05 15:06:52','2015-06-05 14:06:52','<strong>Website Terms and Conditions:</strong>\n\nUse of this website constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions, which take effect immediately on your first use of the website.

HIPPO provides a reliable, affordable and convenient national skip alternative for any sized business.

When you are finished with your HIPPOBAG, simply arrange a collection and our professional drivers will collect your waste and dispose of it responsibly.\r\n\r\nHIPPOBAGs also take up very little space, and you can suit the size of bag to the specific needs of your project; this means you don’t need to pay the full price that you would for a skip if your needs are smaller. You can also segregate waste into different streams using HIPPOBAGs, allowing you to increase recycling rates.\r\n\r\nHIPPO’s environmental policies mean you can rest assured that your waste is being handled and disposed of in a responsible manner. We typically recycle around 90% of the waste that we collect. HIPPO are committed to excellent customer service and have an average customer review rating of 4.7 out of 5.\r\n<h2>Our Waste Logistics Experts</h2>\r\nHIPPO provides waste logistics services for a huge variety of projects.

McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPO recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme. To support the on-site team, HIPPO delivered Toolbox Talks to promote best practice when it comes to positioning, filling and arranging collection of the bags.\r\n\r\nLocating HIPPOBAGs at the point of waste generation allowed McLaren to keep working areas tidy. By labelling the bags for each major waste stream, McLaren were able to fully segregate their material. This proactive approach meant HIPPOWASTE have reported that 97% of the waste collected was diverted from landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPOWASTE</h3>\r\n<em>\"Working in partnership with HIPPO on this project was the ideal solution. The MIDIBAGS allowed us to keep the site tidy, whilst segregating the waste before collection boosted our recycling rates resulting in 97% diversion from landfill.\"</em>\r\n\r\nLeigh Steele, Fit-out Manager, McLaren Construction\r\n\r\n[/quote]','Interior Fit-Out with John Lewis and McLaren Construction','','inherit','open','open','','31-revision-v1','','','2015-06-05 15:15:41','2015-06-05 14:15:41','',31,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/31-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(565,2,'2015-06-05 15:28:19','2015-06-05 14:28:19','<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-563\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/HIPPO-POS.png\" alt=\"HIPPO POS\" width=\"264\" height=\"544\" />Our HIPPOBAG range is available nationally to both the public and trade professionals, in DIY stores, garden centres and independent retailers.

With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n<h2>Nationwide</h2>\r\nHIPPO provides a nationwide network for rapid collection, meaning that you can use our services for your waste logistics needs wherever you are in the country.\r\n<h2>3 bag sizes</h2>\r\nWe offer a choice of 3 bag sizes, meaning that whatever size project you\'re undertaking, we have the perfect bag for you to complete your job. These bags come flat packed, so there is no need to wait for a skip or have to worry about regional skip prices and availability.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has the capacity to hold both a bathroom suite and a medium kitchen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-383\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\" alt=\"construction HIPPO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"578\" /></a>','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-06-05 15:57:06','2015-06-05 14:57:06','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(570,2,'2015-06-05 15:59:05','2015-06-05 14:59:05','<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">HIPPO is a national provider of convenient and ethical waste solutions and the operation behind the HIPPOBAG</h1>','Home','','inherit','open','open','','17-revision-v1','','','2015-06-05 15:59:05','2015-06-05 14:59:05','',17,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/17-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(571,2,'2015-06-05 15:59:51','2015-06-05 14:59:51','Choosing a waste logistics company is a vital decision.

With this level of experience you can be sure of a safe and hassle free collection from your customer’s property. We can also help you to maintain your reputation as a good corporate citizen and fulfil your duty of care to the communities in which you work, by minimising the social and environmental impact of your operations.\r\n<h2>Nationwide</h2>\r\nHIPPO provides a nationwide network for rapid collection, meaning that you can use our services for your waste logistics needs wherever you are in the country.\r\n<h2>3 bag sizes</h2>\r\nWe offer a choice of 3 bag sizes, meaning that whatever size project you\'re undertaking, we have the perfect bag for you to complete your job. These bags come flat packed, so there is no need to wait for a skip or have to worry about regional skip prices and availability.\r\n\r\nAs well as reducing the direct costs of waste management, we can improve operational efficiencies and minimise disruption and distractions to your core activities. A typical sized homes project produces 2-5 cubic yards of waste from kitchen units, bathroom suites, and central heating systems. HIPPOBAGs, from the 1 cubic yard MIDIBAG to the 4.5 yard MIGHTYBAG, are ideal for the disposal of these waste streams. MEGABAGs were designed to hold a bathroom suite and a single MIGHTYBAG has the capacity to hold both a bathroom suite and a medium kitchen.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-383\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/construction1.jpg\" alt=\"construction HIPPO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"578\" /></a>','Housing and Renovation','','inherit','open','open','','11-revision-v1','','','2015-06-05 16:01:07','2015-06-05 15:01:07','',11,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/11-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(578,2,'2015-06-05 16:30:56','2015-06-05 15:30:56','<h2>MIDIBAG</h2>\r\n<img class=\" size-medium wp-image-321 alignleft\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/careers1-300x271.jpg\" alt=\"careers\" width=\"300\" height=\"271\" />\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<strong>1 cubic yard</strong>\r\n<strong> 1 tonne</strong>\r\nThe MIDIBAG was the first HIPPOBAG, and is still the most popular product we offer for home DIY and gardening projects.\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>MEGABAG</h2>\r\n<img class=\" size-full wp-image-575 alignleft\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mega.jpg\" alt=\"Mega\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" />\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<strong>1.5 cubic yards</strong>\r\n<strong> 1.5 tonnes</strong>\r\n\r\nPerfect for disposing of your old bathroom suite (that\'s what we designed it for) as well as general garden, household and DIY waste.\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>MIGHTYBAG</h2>\r\n<strong><img class=\" size-full wp-image-576 alignleft\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Mighty.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" /></strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>4.5 cubic yards</strong>\r\n<strong>1.5 tonnes</strong>\r\n\r\nIdeal for disposing of your kitchen or bathroom rip out, general garden, DIY or household waste.

McLaren Construction recently used the HIPPOBAG to boost environmental performance whilst undertaking their first joint construction and fit-out of a John Lewis Partnership At Home store.\r\n\r\nHIPPO recommended using the MIDIBAG as the most flexible solution; the one cubic yard bags fit comfortably on a standard pallet, allowing easy movement around site using a fork lift or pallet truck. Flat-packed bags were delivered in bulk ready to be placed near the source of the waste, reducing costly double-handling and minimising Health and Safety risks.\r\n\r\nThe bags were then consolidated for regular collection, preventing waste build up on site which could have restricted the project\'s delivery programme. To support the on-site team, HIPPO delivered Toolbox Talks to promote best practice when it comes to positioning, filling and arranging collection of the bags.\r\n\r\nLocating HIPPOBAGs at the point of waste generation allowed McLaren to keep working areas tidy. By labelling the bags for each major waste stream, McLaren were able to fully segregate their material. This proactive approach meant HIPPO have reported that 97% of the waste collected was diverted from landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPO</h3>\r\n<em>\"Working in partnership with HIPPO on this project was the ideal solution.

This meant creating a lot of small rooms using plasterboard.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of pallet trucks, Galliford Try were able to manoeuvre HIPPOBAGs within confined spaces to position them close to where work was being carried out. Once full, the timely collection guarded against double-handling of waste and the subsequent downtime usually associated with waiting for a skip to be delivered and collected.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 plasterboard was reclassified as a non-inert waste that needs to be disposed of separately at landfill at an increased cost. Different to traditional containers for waste, the HIPPOBAGs made it easier for the team on site to segregate the plasterboard from other waste materials so that it could be recycled, rather than sent to landfill.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What they Said About HIPPO</h3>\r\n<em>\"The HIPPOBAG has not only provided Galliford Try with enhanced operational efficiences on site but also the ultimate solution for the segregation and subsequent recycling of plasterboard.\"</em>\r\n\r\nTerry O\'Neil, Site Manager, Galliford Try\r\n\r\n[/quote]','Plasterboard Recycling with Galliford Try','','inherit','open','open','','30-revision-v1','','','2015-06-08 17:01:00','2015-06-08 16:01:00','',30,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/30-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(584,2,'2015-06-08 17:07:24','2015-06-08 16:07:24','<img class=\" size-medium wp-image-185 alignright\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/all-bags-300x212.png\" alt=\"all bags\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" />HIPPO is a national provider of innovative and integrated waste logistics solutions, the HIPPO service caters to the needs of building and construction professionals for their waste removal.\r\n\r\nDriven by the desire to provide an affordable, convenient and reliable waste logistics service for your business, HIPPO uses innovative yellow HIPPOBAGs.

Our training is themed around individuals’ career objectives, departmental requirements, and wider business needs or changes, making sure we’re all ready for our next challenge.\r\n<h2>progression</h2>\r\nWe are particularly proud of our team’s career progression – we’re not a huge organisation, but through creative thinking, an eye for talent, and the flexibility that comes with the Company’s growth and development, we have been able to spot opportunities for people to move to roles which are more senior, more challenging, or represent a change of career. This is great for us, as we retain our committed and talented people - and it allows people with talent and ambition to pursue their career aspirations. 9% of our team were promoted into their current roles, and 12% have moved to a different role during their time with HIPPO.\r\n<h2>how to apply</h2>\r\nIf you are interested in a career at HIPPO, please email your CV with a covering letter to recruitment@hippowaste.co.uk or post it to: HR Department, HIPPO, 1000 Lakeside, North Harbour, Portsmouth PO6 3EN\r\n<h2>Current Vacancies</h2>\r\nWe may not be advertising at this time, but we\'re always on the look out for good people, so why not send us your CV anyway?','Careers at HIPPO','','inherit','open','open','','34-revision-v1','','','2015-06-15 11:11:50','2015-06-15 10:11:50','',34,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/34-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(593,2,'2015-06-15 11:12:44','2015-06-15 10:12:44','<h2><a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/facilities.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-476\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/facilities.jpg\" alt=\"facilities HIPPO\" width=\"400\" height=\"594\" /></a>HIPPO Provides Waste Logistics for Facilities Management</h2>\r\nUsing the HIPPOBAG for the segregation of heavy or substantial inert waste streams, or for any unscheduled or ad hoc waste removal needs will benefit your business in a number of ways.\r\n\r\nHIPPO offers a professional, reliable and fully national service, meaning that we can manage your waste logistics needs across your entire regional or national store estate. HIPPO can work alongside any existing contracts that your business has in place, delivering an efficient waste logistics operation, should you require more than your current contracts are able to deliver.\r\n<h2>flexible</h2>\r\nHIPPO offers a flexible and convenient service that can work around your needs; there are no restricting time limits when using our services and you can arrange a pick up at a suitable time for you.\r\n<h2>reputation</h2>\r\nOur reputation for facilities management services has meant that thousands of HIPPOBAGs are collected from store estates weekly. We ensure that waste we collect is disposed of in an ethical manner, with over 90 per cent of the waste that we collect being recycled.\r\n<h2>3 different sizes</h2>\r\nHIPPOBAGs come in three different sizes and are non-bulky and affordable. Buying the right sized bag for your waste logistics needs will mean that your business will save money, as well as valuable space on site. When used throughout a business on a national or regional store level, significant savings can be made by suiting the size of HIPPOBAGs to your specific needs.','Facilities Management','','inherit','open','open','','14-revision-v1','','','2015-06-15 11:12:44','2015-06-15 10:12:44','',14,'http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/blog/14-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(594,2,'2015-06-15 11:13:09','2015-06-15 10:13:09','<a href=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy-e1426505179570.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-398\" src=\"http://hippo.tailoreddev.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/retail-casestudy-e1426505179570.jpg\" alt=\"construction HIPPO\" width=\"400\" height=\"596\" /></a>HIPPO was awarded the waste management contract by Wates Retail for the construction of Europe’s largest John Lewis department store in Liverpool. The new 240,000 square foot, multi-million pound John Lewis store is part of The Paradise Project – a regeneration project covering 42 acres in the heart of the city.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt over five storeys high, this complex construction development required a flexible, easily transportable waste removal solution. Using HIPPOBAGs enabled Wates to set up waste segregation on each of the four sales floors, making it easy for the site teams to separate the waste at source.\r\n\r\nThe bags could then be easily manoeuvred to the ground floor, where they were placed for collection with no need to double handle the waste into another container.\r\n\r\n[quote]\r\n<h3>What They Said About HIPPO</h3>\r\n<em>\"The different sized HIPPOBAGs are ideal for the various waste streams generated on site and to date the flexibility and versatility afforded by this solution has enabled us to achieve 97% recycling in our first month on site.
